;;; Commentary:

;; beeminder.el provides a simple way for Emacs to interact with the Beeminder
;; API.  It's pretty basic at the moment, but can be used to fetch and submit
;; data.

;; Please set `beeminder-username' and `beeminder-auth-token' before using.

;; You can find your auth token by logging in to Beeminder and then visiting the
;; following URI: https://www.beeminder.com/api/v1/auth_token.json

;;; Keyboard bindings:

;; All keyboard bindings have a C-c b prefix

;; C-c b g    - Insert your goals as an org-mode list
;; C-c b m    - Display username in message line

;;; TODO:

;; [todo] - Replace goalval with the "math_is_hard" values

;;; Code:
