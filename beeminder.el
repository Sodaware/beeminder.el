;;; Commentary:

;; beeminder.el provides a way for Emacs to interact with the Beeminder API.  It
;; adds the following functionality:
;;   - A client for viewing and modifying Beeminder goals.
;;   - Functions for adding data to Beeminder goals.
;;   - Integration with org-mode for submitting clocked time and task completions.
;;   - API access methods for fetching and modifying Beeminder goal information.

;; Please set `beeminder-username' and `beeminder-auth-token' before using.

;; You can find your auth token by logging in to Beeminder and then visiting the
;; following URI: https://www.beeminder.com/api/v1/auth_token.json

;; Load beeminder.el with (require 'beeminder).  This must be called after your
;; Org is set up if you want to use org-mode integration.

;;; Keyboard bindings:

;; We recommend binding commands to the `C-c b` prefix and using the following
;; key bindings in your init.el:

;; (global-set-key "\C-c b a" #'beeminder-add-data)
;; (global-set-key "\C-c b g" #'beeminder-goals)
;; (global-set-key "\C-c b i" #'beeminder-my-goals-org)
;; (global-set-key "\C-c b r" #'beeminder-refresh-goal)
;; (global-set-key "\C-c b w" #'beeminder-whoami)

;; These key bindings are:

;; C-c b a    - Add data to a Beeminder goal.
;; C-c b g    - View your list of goals in an interactive buffer.
;; C-c b i    - Insert your goals as an org-mode list.
;; C-c b r    - Refresh goal information for an org headline.
;; C-c b w    - Display username in message line.

;; The same setup for `use-package` looks like this:

;; (use-package beeminder
;;   :after (org)
;;   :bind
;;   (("C-c b a" . beeminder-add-data)
;;    ("C-c b g" . beeminder-goals)
;;    ("C-c b i" . beeminder-my-goals-org)
;;    ("C-c b r" . beeminder-refresh-goal)
;;    ("C-c b w" . beeminder-whoami)))

;; org-mode integration:

;; You can use C-c C-x p (org-set-property) to add the beeminder property to
;; projects or tasks that are associated with beeminder goals.  Set it to the
;; identifier of your goal (the short name that's in the URL).

;; By default, completing those tasks will log one point.  You can set the
;; beeminder-value property to "prompt" in order to interactively specify the
;; value whenever you complete the task.  Set beeminder-value to "time-today" in
;; order to log the time you clocked today (see "Clocking work time" in the Org
;; manual).

;;; Code:

;; Package setup
(provide 'beeminder)

(cl-eval-when (load eval)
  (require 'beeminder-settings) ;; Settings and properties for module.
  (require 'beeminder-api)      ;; API function wrappers and helpers.
  (require 'beeminder-client)   ;; Interactive functions.
  (require 'beeminder-org))     ;; org-mode functions.
